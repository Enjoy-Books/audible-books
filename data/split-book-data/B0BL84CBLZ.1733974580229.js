window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>On a nightmare world a thousand light years from Earth, one honest cop won’t rest until he solves the mystery of why his colony was condemned there, in this Audible Original story from best-selling author Larry Correia.</b></p> <p>On a planet where life is cheap, in a city built on corruption, very few things are considered holy. The Landing Site is one of them. The remains of the century-old habitat pod—which delivered the colonists to the only barely habitable place on the cruel world of Croatoan—has become a monument to the hardscrabble people who somehow survived the unsurvivable.</p> <p>So when blood is shed on that sacred ground, it’s seen as an attack against the entire colony. With a fanatical terrorist group holding hostages inside the monument, DCI Lutero Cade and the Zenith PD have to end the crisis and put the bad guys down.</p> <p>Only there’s far more to this case than meets the eye. The lander may have been carrying a hidden cargo. And a shadowy figure with his own drone army will do anything to make sure the mission’s secrets stay buried—no matter how many nosy detectives he has to kill to do it.</p>";
