window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>NATIONAL BESTSELLER • From the author of </b><b><i>The Covenant of Water</i></b><b>: A beautifully written, page-turning family saga of Ethiopia and America, doctors and patients, exile and home. • “Filled with mystical scenes and deeply felt characters.... Verghese is something of a magician as a novelist.” —</b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><br> <br> Marion and Shiva Stone are twin brothers born of a secret union between a beautiful Indian nun and a brash British surgeon. Orphaned by their mother’s death and their father’s disappearance, bound together by a preternatural connection and a shared fascination with medicine, the twins come of age as Ethiopia hovers on the brink of revolution. <br> <br> Moving from Addis Ababa to New York City and back again, <i>Cutting for Stone</i> is an unforgettable story of love and betrayal, medicine and ordinary miracles—and two brothers whose fates are forever intertwined.<br> <br> This sweeping, emotionally riveting novel that \"shows how history and landscape and accidents of birth conspire to create the story of a single life\" (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>).</p>";
