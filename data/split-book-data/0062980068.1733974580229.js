Then she met Bruce Lamb. He's a good guy, stable, level-headed, kind—a refreshing twist from her previous relationships. </p> <p>But right before the wedding, Abigail has a moment of uncertainty. The drunken one-night stand from her bachelorette weekend, the sexy guy who wouldn't give her his real name, didn't really mean anything, she keeps telling herself.
