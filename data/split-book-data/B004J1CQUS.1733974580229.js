window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the third trimester of her pregnancy, Baltimore private investigator Tess Monaghan is under doctor's orders to remain immobile. Bored and restless, reduced to watching the world go by outside her window, she takes small comfort in the mundane events she observes... like the young woman in a green raincoat who walks her dog at the same time every day. Then one day the dog is running free and its owner is nowhere to be seen. </p> <p>Certain that something is terribly wrong, and incapable of leaving well enough alone, Tess is determined to get to the bottom of the dog walker's abrupt disappearance, even if she must do so from her own bedroom. But her inquisitiveness is about to fling open a dangerous Pandora's box of past crimes and troubling deaths . . . and she's not only putting her own life in jeopardy but also her unborn child's.</p> <p>Previously serialized in the <i>New York Times</i>, and now published in book form for the very first time, <i>The Girl in the Green Raincoat</i> is a masterful Hitchcockian thriller from one of the very best in the business: multiple award-winner Laura Lippman.</p>";
