window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Harlan Coben has risen to the top of best-seller lists worldwide, attracting voracious audiences for his peerless novels of domestic suspense as well as those featuring his fan-favorite sports agent, Myron Bolitar. Now in <i>Live Wire</i>, he offers a knock-your-socks-off novel that will electrify all his fans: Myron’s family takes center stage. </p> <p>Myron Bolitar has always dreamed about the voluptuous femme fatale walking into his office and asking for help. The woman standing in his doorway has killer curves all right: She’s eight months pregnant, which kind of ruins the fantasy. Former tennis star Suzze T and her rock star husband, Lex, are both clients, and over the years Myron has negotiated his share of contracts for the power pair. But now Lex has disappeared and a very pregnant Suzze is in tears, fearing the online rumors questioning the baby’s paternity have driven away the man she swears is the child’s father. </p> <p>For Myron, questions of fatherhood couldn’t hit closer to home, as his dad, Al, clings to life; the brother who abandoned them all years ago is in trouble; and Myron’s teenage nephew needs an authority figure. Myron is soon forced to confront deep secrets in Suzze’s past; his family’s mortality - and before <i>Live Wire</i> is over, his own.</p>";
