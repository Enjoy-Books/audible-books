Three months to confess the details of that day, and how it changed everything for me.</p> <p>My name is Helena Ross. I've written 15 romance novels, 10 of which have become international best sellers. But this one isn't a romance, no happily ever after in place. This novel holds only the truth, which I have run away from for four years. The truth, which I have hidden from the police, from my loved ones, from the world.</p> <p>This final book?</p> <p>It's my confession.</p>";
