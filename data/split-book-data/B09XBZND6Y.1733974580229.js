For the next several months, it’s just Lucy, William, and their complex past together in a little house nestled against the moody, swirling sea.<br> <br> Rich with empathy and emotion, <i>Lucy by the Sea</i> vividly captures the fear and struggles that come with isolation, as well as the hope, peace, and possibilities that those long, quiet days can inspire. At the heart of this story are the deep human connections that unite us even when we’re apart—the pain of a beloved daughter’s suffering, the emptiness that comes from the death of a loved one, the promise of a new friendship, and the comfort of an old, enduring love.</p> <p><b>Shortlisted for the Rathbones Folio Prize</b></p>";
