window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>#1 </b><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i></b><b>BESTSELLER • From the beloved author of </b><b><i>Big Little Lies, Apples Never Fall, </i></b><b>and</b><b><i> The Husband’s Secret </i></b><b>comes a moving novel of love, marriage, family, and trying to find certainty in a fragile world.</b><br> <br> <b>“A riveting story so wild you don’t know how she’ll land it, and then she does, on a dime.”—Anne Lamott</b><br> <b> <br> AN NPR BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR</b><br> <br> <i>Life is full of twists and turns you never see coming. But what if you did?</i><br> <br> The plane is jam-packed. Every seat is taken. So of course the flight is delayed! Flight attendant Allegra Patel likes her job—she’s generally happy with her life, even if she can’t figure out why she hooks up with a man she barely speaks to—but today is her twenty-eighth birthday. She can think of plenty of things she’d rather be doing than placating a bunch of grumpy passengers.<br> <br> There’s the well-dressed man in seat 4C who is compulsively checking his watch, desperate not to miss his eleven-year-old daughter’s musical. Further back, a mother of two is frantically trying to keep her toddler entertained and her infant son quiet. How did she ever think being a stay-at-home mom would be easier than being a lawyer? Ethan is lost in thought; he’s flying back from his first funeral. A young couple has just gotten married; she’s still wearing her wedding dress. An emergency room nurse is looking forward to traveling the world once she retires in a few years, it’s going to be so much fun! If they ever get off the tarmac. . . .<br> <br> Suddenly a woman none of them know stands up. She makes predictions about how and when everyone on board will die. Some dismiss her. Others will do everything they can to make sure her prophecies do not come to pass. All of them will be forever changed.<br> <br> How would you live your life if you thought you knew how it would end? Would you love who you love or try to love someone else? Would you stay married? Would you stop drinking? Would you call up your ex-best friend you haven’t spoken to in years? Would you quit your job?<br> <br> Intricately plotted, with the wonderful wit Liane Moriarty has become famous for, <i>Here One Moment</i> brilliantly looks at friends, lovers, and family and how we manage to hold onto them in our harried modern lives.</p>";
