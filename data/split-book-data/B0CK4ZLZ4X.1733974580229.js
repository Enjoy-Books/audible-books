It is </b><b><i>Big, Little Lies </i></b><b>meets </b><b><i>Grey’s Anatomy </i></b><b>in this delicious and satisfying mystery about friendship, love, and why we choose the work we do. Christie Watson has written a masterpiece.”—Kate Bowler, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>Everything Happens for a Reason (and Other Lies I’ve Loved)</i></b></p> <p><b>From the author of the smash UK bestseller </b><b><i>The Language of Kindness</i></b><b> comes an electrifying, high-stakes literary thriller following three best friends since medical school and the twenty-five-year-old secret that now threatens to shatter their lives.</b></p> <p><i>When you're trained to protect the lives of others, how far will you go to protect your own?</i></p> <p>Ruthlessly ambitious Olivia, anxious perfectionist Laura, and free-spirited risk-taker Anjali couldn’t be more different. Yet their friendship—which began the first day of medical school—has kept them inseparable these past twenty-five years. As wild all-nighters and exam pressure gave way to the struggles and joys of new motherhood and new jobs, their unbreakable bond helped them support each other through it all.</p> <p>Long ago, they promised that nothing would come between them, and to do anything for one another—including burying that night they have never spoken about: a university party fueled by drugs, sex, and secrets that forced them to make a deadly choice that could have destroyed them. But is there a limit to what we would do for those we love?</p> <p>When an eerily similar tragedy strikes involving the women’s teenaged children, everything the three friends have built threatens to crumble around them . . . forcing them to decide how far they can stretch their friendship before it snaps.</p> <p>A taut and explosive novel about loyalty, ambition, betrayal, and revenge, <i>Moral Injuries</i> explores the sometimes-hidden costs of friendships, and the lengths people will go to protect themselves.</p>";
