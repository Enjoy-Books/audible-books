window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One evening in 1951, an itinerant storyteller arrives unannounced at a house in the Irish countryside. In exchange for a bed and a warm meal, he invites his hosts and their neighbors to join him by the wintry fireside and begins to tell formative stories of Ireland's history. Ronan, a nine-year-old boy, grows so entranced by the storytelling that, when the old man leaves abruptly under mysterious circumstances, the boy devotes himself to finding him again. </p> <p>Ronan's search for the Storyteller becomes both a journey of self-discovery, long unspoken family secrets, and an immersion into the sometimes conflicting histories of his native land.</p> <p>A sweeping novel of huge ambition, <i>Ireland</i> is the beautifully told story of a remarkable nation. It rings with the truth of a writer passionate about his country and in full command of his craft.</p>";
