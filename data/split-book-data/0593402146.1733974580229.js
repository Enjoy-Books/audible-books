You have to be rich to have a house there, and Fred and Sheila Merton certainly <i>are</i> rich. But even all their money can't protect them when a killer comes to call. The Mertons are brutally murdered after a fraught Easter dinner with their three adult kids. Who, of course, are devastated.</p> <p>Or are they? They each stand to inherit millions.

Did someone snap after that dreadful evening? Or did another person appear later that night with the worst of intentions? That must be what happened. After all, if one of the family were capable of something as gruesome as this, you'd know.</p> <p>Wouldn't you?</p>";
