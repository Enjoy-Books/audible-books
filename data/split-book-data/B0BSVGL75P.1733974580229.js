But I can’t risk losing this job—not if I want to keep my darkest secret safe....</b></p> <p>It’s hard to find an employer who doesn’t ask too many questions about my past. So I thank my lucky stars that the Garricks miraculously give me a job, cleaning their stunning penthouse with views across the city and preparing fancy meals in their shiny kitchen. I can work here for a while, stay quiet until I get what I want.</p> <p>It’s almost perfect. But I still haven’t met Mrs Garrick, or seen inside the guest bedroom. I’m sure I hear her crying. I notice spots of blood around the neck of her white nightgowns when I’m doing laundry. And one day I can’t help but knock on the door. When it gently swings open, what I see inside changes <i>everything</i>....<br> <br> That’s when I make a promise. After all, I’ve done this before. I can protect Mrs. Garrick while keeping my own secrets locked up safe.</p> <p>Douglas Garrick has done wrong. He is going to pay. It’s simply a question of how far I’m willing to go....</p> <p><b>Anyone who loves </b><b><i>The Perfect Marriage</i></b><b> by Jeneva Rose, </b><b><i>The Woman in the Window</i></b><b>, and </b><b><i>Gone Girl</i></b><b> will be totally hooked! This book can also be enjoyed as a stand-alone.</b></p>";
