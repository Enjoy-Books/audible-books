window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Diviner Alex Verus and the Council that governs the magical community have never gotten along. But with his former teacher back in Britain, Alex is in desperate need of allies, and he'll do whatever it takes to get them - even if it means accepting a job with the Keepers, enforcing magical law. Alex forms an uneasy alliance with his new partner, Caldera, but his attempt at legitimacy quickly turns lethal when a mission puts him in possession of an item that factions both inside and outside of the Council would kill to get their hands on. </p> <p>Once again caught in the middle of a deadly conflict, Alex will need all his abilities to figure out who his friends are - especially when enemies are hiding on all sides.... </p>";
