window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this thrilling stand-alone from the internationally best-selling author of the Frieda Klein series, a married woman’s affair with her boss spirals into a dangerous game of chess with the police when she discovers he’s been murdered and she clears the crime scene of all evidence. </b></p> <p><b><i>One little secret between a married woman, her lover, and a killer. </i></b></p> <p>It should have been just a mid-life fling. A guilty indiscretion that Neve Connolly could have weathered. An escape from 20 years of routine marriage to her overworked husband, and from her increasingly distant children. But when Neve pays a morning-after visit to her lover, Saul, and finds him brutally murdered, their pied-à-terre still heady with her perfume, all the lies she has so painstakingly stitched together threaten to unravel. </p> <p>After scrubbing clean every trace of her existence from Saul’s life - and death - Neve believes she can return to normal, shaken but intact. But she can’t get out of her head the one tormenting question: <i>What was she forgetting? </i></p> <p>An investigation into the slaying could provide the answer. It’s brought Detective Chief Inspector Alastair Hitching, and Neve’s worst fears, to her door. But with every new lie, every new misdirection to save herself, Neve descends further into the darkness of her betrayal - and into more danger than she ever imagined. Because Hitching isn’t the only one watching Neve. So is a determined killer who’s about to make the next terrifying move in a deadly affair....</p>";
