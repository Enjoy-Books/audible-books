window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the highly anticipated finale to the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling trilogy, dictators, prophets, and tensions rise. In a world thatâ€™s conquered death, will humanity finally be torn asunder by the immortal beings it created? </p> <p>Citra and Rowan have disappeared. Endura is gone. It seems like nothing stands between Scythe Goddard and absolute dominion over the world scythedom.
