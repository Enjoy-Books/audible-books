window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“Twisty and complex, with unexpected turns…and characters you really root for.”—Emily Henry, #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author</b></p> <p><b>From the author of the Reese’s Book Club Pick and the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestseller </b><b><i>Wrong Place Wrong Time</i></b><b> comes a new heart-stopping thriller in which a missing-person case unravels deeper, darker secrets that lead a detective to an impossible moral choice.</b></p> <p><i>Not everyone who is lost should be found…</i></p> <p>Twenty-two-year-old Olivia has been missing for one day…and counting. She was last seen on CCTV, entering a dead-end alley. And not coming back out again.</p> <p>Julia, the detective heading up the search for Olivia, thinks she knows what to expect. A desperate family, a ticking clock, and long hours away from her husband and daughter. But she has no idea just how close to home this case is going to get.</p> <p>Because the criminal at the heart of the disappearance has something she never expected. His weapon isn’t a gun, or a knife: it’s a secret. Her worst one. And her family's safety depends on one thing: Julia must NOT find out what happened to Olivia - and must frame somebody else for her murder.</p> <p>If you find her, you will lose everything. <i>What would you do?</i></p> <p>This clever and endlessly surprising thriller is laced with a clever look at family and motherhood, and cements Gillian McAllister as a major talent in the world of suspense and a master of creating ethical dilemmas that show just how murky the distinction between right and wrong can be.</p>";
