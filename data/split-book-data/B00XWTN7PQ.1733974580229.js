window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What should be a cozy and fun-filled weekend deep in the English countryside takes a sinister turn in Ruth Ware's suspenseful, compulsive, and darkly twisted psychological thriller. </p> <p>Leonora, known to some as Lee and others as Nora, is a reclusive crime writer, unwilling to leave her nest of an apartment unless it is absolutely necessary. When a friend she hasn't seen or spoken to in years unexpectedly invites Nora (<i>Lee</i>) to a weekend away in an eerie glass house deep in the English countryside, she reluctantly agrees to make the trip. Forty-eight hours later, she wakes up in a hospital bed injured but alive, with the knowledge that someone is dead. Wondering not \"what happened?\" but \"what have I done?\", Nora (<i>Lee</i>) tries to piece together the events of the past weekend. Working to uncover secrets, reveal motives, and find answers, Nora (<i>Lee</i>) must revisit parts of herself that she would much rather leave buried where they belong: in the past. </p> <p>In the tradition of Paula Hawkins' instant <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>The Girl on the Train</i> and S. J. Watson's riveting national sensation <i>Before I Go to Sleep</i>, this gripping literary debut from UK novelist Ruth Ware will leave you on the edge of your seat through the very last second. </p> <p>Includes an excerpt from Ruth Ware's <i>The Lying Game</i>! </p>";
