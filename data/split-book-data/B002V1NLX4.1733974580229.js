window.bookSummaryJSON = "The California dream weavers have invaded Charm City with their cameras, their stars, and their controversy. <p>When private investigator Tess Monaghan literally runs into the crew of the fledgling TV series <i>Mann of Steel</i> while sculling, she expects sharp words and evil looks, not an assignment. But the company has been plagued by a series of disturbing incidents since its arrival on location in Baltimore: bad press, union threats, and small, costly on-set \"accidents\" that have wreaked havoc with its shooting schedule. As a result, <i>Mann</i>'s creator, Flip Tumulty, the son of a Hollywood legend, is worried for the safety of his young female lead, Selene Waites, and asks Tess to serve as her bodyguard/babysitter. Tumulty's concern may be well founded. Not long ago, a Baltimore man was discovered dead in his own home, surrounded by photos of the beautiful, difficult superstar-in-the-making.</p> <p>In the past, Tess has had enough trouble guarding her own body. Keeping a spoiled movie princess under wraps may be more than she can handle - even with the help of Tess' icily unflappable friend Whitney - since Selene is not as naive as everyone seems to think and is far more devious than she initially appears to be.</p> <p>This is not Tess' world. And these are not her kind of people, with their vanities, their self-serving agendas and invented personas, and their remarkably skewed visions of reality - from the series' aging, shallow, former pretty-boy leading man to its resentful, always-on-the-make co-writer, to the officious young assistant who may be too hungry for her own good.</p> <p>But the fish-out-of-water P.I. is abruptly pulled back in by an occurrence she's all too familiar with: murder. Suddenly, the wall of secrets around <i>Mann of Steel</i> is in danger of toppling, leaving shattered dreams, careers, and lives scattered among the ruins - a catastrophe that threatens the people Tess cares about...and the city she loves.</p>";
