window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The very young men who flew the B24s over Germany in World War II against terrible odds were an exemplary band of brothers. In <i>The Wild Blue</i>, Stephen Ambrose recounts their extraordinary brand of heroism, skill, daring, and comradeship. </p> <p>Ambrose describes how the Army Air Forces recruited, trained, and chose those few who would undertake the most demanding and dangerous jobs in the war. These are the boys - turned pilots, bombardiers, navigators, and gunners of the B24s - who suffered over 50 percent casualties. </p> <p>Ambrose carries us along in the crowded, uncomfortable, and dangerous B24s as their crews fought to the death through thick, black, deadly flak to reach their targets and destroy the German war machine or else went down in flames. Twenty-two-year-old George McGovern, who was to become a United States senator and a presidential candidate, flew 35 combat missions (all the Army would allow) and won the Distinguished Flying Cross. We meet him and his mates, his co-pilot killed in action, and crews of other planes - many of whom did not come back. </p> <p>As <i>Band of Brothers</i> and <i>Citizen Soldiers</i> portrayed the bravery and ultimate victory of the American soldier from Normandy on to Germany, <i>The Wild Blue</i> makes clear the contribution these young men of the Army Air Forces stationed in Italy made to the Allied victory.</p>";
