window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>The Golden Couple</i></b><b> is the next electrifying audiobook from Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen, the number one </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best-selling author duo behind </b><b><i>You Are Not Alone</i></b><b>,</b><b><i> An Anonymous Girl</i></b><b>, and </b><b><i>The Wife Between Us</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>If Avery Chambers can’t fix you in 10 sessions, she won’t take you on as a client. Her successes are phenomenal—she helps people overcome everything from domineering parents to assault—and almost absorbs the emptiness she sometimes feels since her husband’s death.</p> <p>Marissa and Mathew Bishop seem like the golden couple—until Marissa cheats. She wants to repair things, both because she loves her husband and for the sake of their eight-year-old son. After a friend forwards an article about Avery, Marissa takes a chance on this maverick therapist, who lost her license due to controversial methods.</p> <p>When the Bishops glide through Avery’s door and Marissa reveals her infidelity, all three are set on a collision course. Because the biggest secrets in the room are still hidden, and it’s no longer simply a marriage that’s in danger.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press</b></p> <p>\"My favorite kind of thriller: a guessing game filled with characters you care about and twists you don't see coming. <i>The Golden Couple</i> takes a deep dive into a marriage, where what you see on the surface is not necessarily the truth, and the results are mesmerizing. Add to this a therapist who doesn't play by the rules and you have an utterly compelling, spellbinding read.\" (Lisa Jewell, author of <i>Then She Was Gone</i> and <i>Invisible Girl</i>)</p> <p>\"Narrators Marin Ireland and Karissa Vacker dazzle as they deliver this twisted domestic thriller.\" (<i>AudioFile</i>)</p>";
