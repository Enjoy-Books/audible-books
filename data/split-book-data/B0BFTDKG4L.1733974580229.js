Riyria is born...</b></p> <p>For more than a year Royce Melborn has tried to forget Gwen DeLancy, the woman who saved him and his partner Hadrian Blackwater from certain death. Unable to get her out of his mind, Royce returns to Medford with Hadrian but the two receive a very different reception—Gwen refuses to see them.

What she doesn't realize is what the two are capable of—but she's about to find out.</p> <p>Performed by Bradley Foster Smith, David M.
