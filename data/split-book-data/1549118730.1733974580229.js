Then her husband comes downstairs with an announcement, and Anna is suddenly, shockingly alone.</p> <p>Reeling, desperate for distraction, Anna returns to the podcast. Other people's problems are much better than one's own - a sunken yacht, a murdered family, a hint of international conspiracy. But this case actually <i>is</i> Anna's problem.
