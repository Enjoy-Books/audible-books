window.bookSummaryJSON = "It came in a plain brown wrapper, no return address: an audiocassette of a soul-lacerating scream, followed by an enigmatic, haunting message delivered in a childlike voice: \"Bad love. Bad love. Don't give me the bad love.\" <p> For psychologist-detective Dr. Alex Delaware, the chant, repeated over and over like a twisted nursery rhyme, is the first intimation that he is about to enter a living nightmare. If Alex fails to discover the escalating pattern of violence and to decipher the twisted logic of the stalker's mind games, he will be the next to die.</p>";
