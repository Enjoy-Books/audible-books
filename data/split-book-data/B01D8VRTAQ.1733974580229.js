window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the best-selling author of <i>My Sister's Keeper</i> comes the riveting story of a murder that shatters the picturesque calm of Amish country - and tests the heart and soul of the lawyer defending the woman at the center of the storm. </p> <p>The discovery of a dead infant in an Amish barn shakes Lancaster County to its core. But the police investigation leads to a more shocking disclosure: Circumstantial evidence suggests that 18-year-old Katie Fisher, an unmarried Amish woman believed to be the newborn's mother, took the child's life. When Ellie Hathaway, a disillusioned big-city attorney, comes to Paradise, Pennsylvania, to defend Katie, two cultures collide - and for the first time in her high-profile career, Ellie faces a system of justice very different from her own. Delving deep inside the world of those who live \"plain\", Ellie must find a way to reach Katie on her terms. And as she unravels a tangled murder case, Ellie also looks deep within - to confront her own fears and desires when a man from her past reenters her life. </p>";
