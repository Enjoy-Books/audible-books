window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Monsters, gods, and mayhem....</b></p> <p>Police Chief Delaney Reed can handle the Valkyries, werewolves, gill-men and other paranormal creatures who call the small beach town of Ordinary, Oregon their home. It’s the vacationing gods who keep her up at night. </p> <p>With the famous rhubarb festival right around the corner, small-town tensions, tempers, and godly tantrums are at an all-time high. The last thing Delaney needs is her ex-boyfriend reappearing just when she's finally caught the attention of Ryder Bailey, the one man she should never love. </p> <p>No, scratch that. The actual last thing she needs is a dead body washing ashore, especially since the dead body is a god. </p> <p>Catching a murderer, wrestling a god power, and re-scheduling the apocalypse? Just another day on the job in Ordinary. Falling in love with her childhood friend while trying to keep the secrets of her town secret? That’s gonna take some work.</p> <p>Performed by Colleen Delany, Henry Kramer, Amanda Forstrom, Karen Novack, Nick DePinto, Matthew Bassett, Terence Aselford, Richard Rohan, Jason B McIntosh, Holly Vagley, Lolita Horne, Michael Glenn, Chris Genebach, Jessica Lauren Ball, Faith Potts, David Jourdan, Kimberly Gilbert, Michael John Casey, Joy Jones, Scott McCormick, Tony Nam, Eleanor Todd, Jonathon Church, Ken Jackson, Lise Bruneau, Zeke Alton, Chris Stinson, Elizabeth Jernigan, Bradley Smith.</p>";
