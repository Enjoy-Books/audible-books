window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the beloved author of </b><b><i>Love, Nina</i></b><b>, a frank, tender, and poignantly funny story about the ebb and flow of female friendship over half a lifetime.</b></p> <p>Susan and Norma have been best friends for years, at first thrust together by force of circumstance (a job at The Pin Cushion, a haberdashery shop in 1990s Leicestershire) and then by force of character (neither being particularly inclined to make friends with anyone else). But now, 30 years later, faced with a husband seeking immortality and Norma out of reach on a wave of professional glory, Susan begins to wonder whether she has made the right choices about life, love, work, and, most importantly, friendship.</p> <p>Nina Stibbe's new novel is the story of the wonderful and sometimes surprising path of friendship: from its conspiratorial beginnings, along its irritating wrong turns, to its final gratifying destination.</p>";
