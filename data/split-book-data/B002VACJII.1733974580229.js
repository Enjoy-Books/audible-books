She barely escapes with her life but cannot save the two others gunned down before her disbelieving eyes. Stunned and heartbroken, Vicki tries to figure out how a routine meeting on a minor case became a double homicide. </p> <p>Vicki's suspicions take her to Devil's Corner, a city neighborhood teetering on the brink of ruin, thick with broken souls, innocent youth, and a scourge that preys on both. But the deeper Vicki probes, the more she becomes convinced that the murders weren't random and the killers were more ruthless than she thought.</p> <p>When another murder thrusts Vicki together with an unlikely ally, she buckles up for a wild ride down a dangerous street and into the crosshairs of a conspiracy as powerful as it is relentless.</p>";
