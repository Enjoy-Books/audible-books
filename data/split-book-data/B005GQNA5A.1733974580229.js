window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Duke University gave free iPods to the freshman class in 2003, critics said they were wasting their money. Yet when the students in practically every discipline invented academic uses for the music players, suddenly the idea could be seen in a new light - as an innovative way to turn learning on its head. </p> <p>Using cutting-edge research on the brain, Cathy N. Davidson show how attention blindness has produced one of our society's greatest challenges: while we acknowledge the great changes of the digital age, most of us still toil in schools and workplaces designed for the last century. </p> <p><i>Now You See</i> It introduces us to visionaries and groundbreaking ideas from schools with curriculums built around video games to companies that train workers using virtual environments. A refreshingly optimistic argument and a bold embrace of our connected, collaborative future.</p>";
