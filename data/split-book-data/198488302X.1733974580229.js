window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From #1 bestselling author Lisa Scottoline comes a pulse-pounding new novel.</b><br> <br> <b>Your family has been attacked, never again to be the same. </b><br> <b>Now you have to choose between law…and justice.</b> </p> <p>Jason Bennett is a suburban dad who owns a court-reporting business, but one night, his life takes a horrific turn. He is driving his family home after his daughter’s field hockey game when a pickup truck begins tailgating them, on a dark stretch of road. Suddenly two men jump from the pickup and pull guns on Jason, demanding the car. A horrific flash of violence changes his life forever. </p> <p>Later that awful night, Jason and his family receive a visit from the FBI. The agents tell them that the carjackers were members of a dangerous drug-trafficking organization—and now Jason and his family are in their crosshairs.<br> <br> The agents advise the Bennetts to enter the witness protection program right away, and they have no choice but to agree. But WITSEC was designed to protect criminal informants, not law-abiding families. Taken from all they know, trapped in an unfamiliar life, the Bennetts begin to fall apart at the seams. Then Jason learns a shocking truth and realizes that he has to take matters into his own hands.<br> <br> <b>Sometimes justice is a one-man show.</b></p>";
