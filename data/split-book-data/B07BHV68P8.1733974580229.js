window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the international best-selling author of <i>Unraveling Oliver</i>, an “unputdownable psychological thriller with an ending that lingers long after turning the final page” (<i>The Irish Times</i>) about a Dublin family whose dark secrets and twisted relationships are suddenly revealed. </p> <p><i>My husband did not mean to kill Annie Doyle, but the lying tramp deserved it.</i> </p> <p>On the surface, Lydia Fitzsimons has the perfect life - wife of a respected, successful judge, mother to a beloved son, mistress of a beautiful house in Dublin. That beautiful house, however, holds a secret. And when Lydia’s son, Laurence, discovers its secret, wheels are set in motion that lead to an increasingly claustrophobic and devastatingly dark climax. </p> <p>For fans of Ruth Ware and Gillian Flynn, this novel is a “seductively sinister story. The twists come together in a superbly scary denouncement, which delivers a final sting in the tail. Brilliantly macabre” (<i>Sunday Mirror</i>).</p>";
