window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The home was top-notch New Jersey suburban. The living room was Martha Stewart. The basement was Legos...and blood.</b></p> <p>For sports agent Myron Bolitar, the disappearance of a man he once competed against was bringing back memories, of the sport he and Greg Downing had both played and the woman they both loved. Now, among the stars, the wanna-bes, the gamblers, and the groupies, Myron is unraveling the strange, violent ride of a sports hero gone wrong, and coming face-to-face with a past he can't relive, and a present he may not survive.</p> <p>In novels that crackle with wit and suspense, Edgar Award winner Harlan Coben has created one of the most fascinating and complex heroes in suspense fiction - Myron Bolitar - a hotheaded, tenderhearted sports agent who grows more and more engaging and unpredictable with each appearance. </p>";
