As the best-selling epic races to its breathtaking finale, Justin Cronin’s band of hardened survivors await the second coming of unspeakable darkness. </p> <p>The world we knew is gone. What world will rise in its place? </p> <p>The Twelve have been destroyed, and the terrifying hundred-year reign of darkness that descended upon the world has ended. The survivors are stepping outside their walls, determined to build society anew - and daring to dream of a hopeful future. </p> <p>But far from them, in a dead metropolis, he waits: Zero. The First. Father of the Twelve. The anguish that shattered his human life haunts him, and the hatred spawned by his transformation burns bright. His fury will be quenched only when he destroys Amy - humanity's only hope, the Girl from Nowhere who grew up to rise against him. </p> <p>One last time light and dark will clash, and at last Amy and her friends will know their fate. </p> <p>Look for the entire Passage trilogy:</p> <p><i>The Passage</i><br> <i> The Twelve</i><br> <i> The City of Mirrors </i> </p> <p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>The City of Mirrors</i></b></p> <p>\"Compulsively readable.” (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>)</p> <p>“<i>The City of Mirrors</i> is poetry.
