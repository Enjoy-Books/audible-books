window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the \"Dickens of our age\" (</b><b><i>Green Valley News</i></b><b>) and </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>Beartown </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>A Man Called Ove</i></b><b>, a heart-wrenching story of how loyalty, friendship, and love carry a town through its darkest days.</b></p> <p>After everything that the citizens of Beartown have gone through, they are struck yet another blow when they learn that their beloved local hockey team will soon be disbanded. What makes it worse is the obvious satisfaction that all the former Beartown players, who now play for a rival team in Hed, take in that fact. Amidst the mounting tension between the two rivals, a surprising newcomer is handpicked to be Beartown's new hockey coach.</p> <p>Soon a new team starts to take shape around Amat, the fastest player you'll ever see; Benji, the crazed lone wolf; and Vidar, a born-to-be-bad troublemaker. Bringing this team together is a challenge as old bonds are broken, new ones are formed, and the enmity with Hed grows more and more acute.</p> <p>As the big match approaches, the not-so-innocent pranks and incidents between the communities pile up, and hatred grows deeper. When the last game is finally played, one of Beartown's key players will be dead, and residents of both towns are forced to wonder whether, after all they've been through, the game they love can ever return to something simple and innocent.</p> <p><i>Us Against You</i> is a declaration of love for all the big and small, bright and dark stories that form and color our communities. Compelling and heartbreaking, it's a roller-coaster ride of emotions with Fredrik \"Backman's pitch-perfect dialogue and an unparalleled understanding of human nature\" (<i>Shelf Awareness</i>).</p>";
