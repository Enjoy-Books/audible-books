window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this brilliant crime novel from the author of </b><b><i>Missing, Presumed</i></b><b>, a detective investigates her most personal case yet: a high-profile murder in which her own family falls under suspicion. </b></p> <p>\"[Susie] Steiner populates this hot-button narrative with achingly human characters, but no one compares to the hormonal, mordantly funny mom-cop who will stop at nothing to save her son.\" [<i>People</i> (Book of the Week)]</p> <p>As dusk falls, a young man staggers through a park, far from home, bleeding from a stab wound. He dies where he falls, cradled by a stranger, a woman's name on his lips in his last seconds of life. </p> <p>Detective Manon Bradshaw handles only cold cases. Five months pregnant, in pursuit of a work-life balance rather than romantic love, she's focused on being a good mother to her two children: her adopted 12-year-old son, Fly Dent, and the new baby. But the man died just yards from the police station where she works, so Manon can't help taking an interest. And as she sidles in on the briefing she learns that the victim, a banker from London worth millions, is more closely linked to her than she could have imagined. </p> <p>When the case begins to circle in on Manon's home and her family, she finds herself pitted against the colleagues she once held dear: Davy Walker and Harriet Harper. Can Manon separate what she knows about the people she loves from the suspicion hanging over them? Can she investigate the evidence just as she would with any other case? </p> <p><i>Persons Unknown</i> shows acclaimed author Susie Steiner writing her most intricate, suspenseful novel yet.</p> <p>\"A police procedural as concerned with the mysteries of human hearts as with who stabbed a banker to death at a park in Cambridgeshire. [Full of] winning prose, sympathetic characters and an appreciation of life's joys as keen as a knowledge of its dangers.\" (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>)</p> <p>\"Susie Steiner blends the police procedural and the human drama perfectly.\" (<i>The Charlotte Observer</i>)</p> <p>\"[An] engrossing stunner, incorporating social justice issues into the narrative, along with superb plotting, dark humor, and excellent characterizations.\" (<i>Library Journal</i>)</p>";
