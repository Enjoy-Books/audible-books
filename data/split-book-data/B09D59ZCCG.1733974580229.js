window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My name is Larkspur, and I am an Elemental. </p> <p>My people use the power of the earth to sustain life and defy our enemies. I should be at my father's side as a royal princess. But as a half-breed, bastard child, that isn't going to happen. </p> <p>The King is missing and his mind is cracked. It is up to me to find him before the Rim is taken over by the bloodthirsty heir to the throne. </p> <p>But the path to finding the King is anything but straight, and I find myself in the human world facing possible banishment. All to find a Tracker who happens to be on the run from a demon, yet she is my only hope in bringing my father home. </p> <p>Nothing is as it seems and I'm uncertain who is friend or foe. My impending punishment threatens to suffocate me as I defy our laws and fight to bring peace to my home...and fight to keep those I love the dearest alive. </p> <p>How will I get both my father and I out of this one unscathed? </p> <p>Welcome to being The Chosen One. </p> <p>Performed by Yasmin Tuazon, Eric Messner, Ken Jackson, Holly Adams, Anthony Palmini, Niusha Nawab, Lydia Kraniotis, Nanette Savard, Rayner Gabriel, Dawn Ursula, Julie Hoverson, Yasmin Tuazon, Amanda Forstrom, Bradley Foster Smith, Carolyn Kashner, Chris Davenport, Christopher Graybill, Christopher Williams, Colleen Delany, Daniel Llaca, Danny Gavigan, Debi Tinsley, Henry W.
