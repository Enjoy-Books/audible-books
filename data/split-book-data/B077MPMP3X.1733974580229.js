window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Laura Lippman returns with a superb novel of psychological suspense about a pair of lovers with the best intentions and the worst luck: two people locked in a passionate yet uncompromising game of cat and mouse. But instead of rules, this game has dark secrets, forbidden desires, inevitable betrayals - and cold-blooded murder. </b></p> <p><i>One is playing a long game. But which one?</i> </p> <p>They meet at a local tavern in the small town of Belleville, Delaware. Polly is set on heading west. Adam says he's also passing through. Yet she stays, and he stays - drawn to this mysterious redhead whose quiet stillness both unnerves and excites him. Over the course of a punishing summer, Polly and Adam abandon themselves to a steamy, inexorable affair. Still, each holds something back from the other - dangerous, even lethal secrets. </p> <p>Then someone dies. Was it an accident or part of a plan? By now Adam and Polly are so ensnared in each other's lives and lies that neither one knows how to get away - or even if they want to. Is their love strong enough to withstand the truth, or will it ultimately destroy them? </p> <p>Something - or someone - has to give. </p> <p><i>Which one will it be?</i> </p> <p>Inspired by James M. Cain's masterpieces <i>The Postman Always Rings Twice</i>, <i>Double Indemnity</i>, and <i>Mildred Pierce</i>, <i>Sunburn </i>is a tantalizing modern noir from the incomparable Laura Lippman. </p>";
