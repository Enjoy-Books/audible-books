window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Bennie Rosato, the founder of the Rosato &amp; DiNunzio law firm, hides her big heart beneath her tough-as-nails exterior, and she doesn't like to fail. Now a case from her past shows her how differently things might have turned out. </p> <p>Thirteen years ago, Bennie Rosato took on Jason Leftavick, a 12-year-old boy who was sent to a juvenile detention center after fighting a class bully. Bennie couldn't free Jason, and to this day it's the case that haunts her. Jason has grown up in and out of juvenile prison, and his adulthood hasn't been any easier. Bennie no longer represents those accused of murder, but when Jason is indicted for killing the same bully he fought with as a kid, she sees no choice but to represent him. She doesn't know whether or not to believe his claims of innocence, but she knows she owes him for past failures - of the law, of the juvenile justice system, and of herself. Forced to relive the darkest period of her life, Bennie will do everything in her power to get the truth - and justice. </p>";
