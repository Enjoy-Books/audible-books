window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Instant </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> Best Seller </b></p> <p><b>Long Listed for The Booker Prize</b></p> <p><b>“Tyler's novels are always worth scooping up - but especially this gently amusing soother, right now.” (NPR) </b></p> <p><b>From the beloved and best-selling Anne Tyler, a sparkling new novel about misperception, second chances, and the sometimes elusive power of human connection.</b></p> <p>Micah Mortimer is a creature of habit. A self-employed tech expert, superintendent of his Baltimore apartment building, cautious to a fault behind the steering wheel, he seems content leading a steady, circumscribed life. But one day, his routines are blown apart when his woman friend (he refuses to call anyone in her late 30s a \"girlfriend\") tells him she's facing eviction, and a teenager shows up at Micah's door claiming to be his son. These surprises, and the ways they throw Micah's meticulously organized life off-kilter, risk changing him forever. </p> <p>An intimate look into the heart and mind of a man who finds those around him just out of reach, and a funny, joyful, deeply compassionate story about seeing the world through new eyes, <i>Redhead by the Side of the Road</i> is a triumph, filled with Anne Tyler's signature wit and gimlet-eyed observation.</p>";
