window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Author Laurie Gelman delivers her second in the Class Mom series in a style no less enthusiastic than her first narration.\" (</b><b><i>AudioFile</i></b><b> Magazine) </b></p> <p><b>In the eagerly anticipated follow-up to Laurie Gelman’s \"irreverent and hilarious\" (</b><b><i>The New York Post</i></b><b>)</b> <b>hit </b><b><i>Class Mom</i></b><b>, brash, lovable Jen Dixon is back with a new class and her work cut out for her. </b></p> <p>If you’ve ever been a room parent or school volunteer, Jen Dixon is your hero. She says what every class mom is really thinking, whether in her notoriously frank emails or standup-worthy interactions with the micromanaging PTA President and the gamut of difficult parents. Luckily, she has the charm and wit to get away with it - most of the time. Jen is sassier than ever but dealing with a whole new set of challenges in the world of parental politics and at home. </p> <p>She’s been roped into room-parenting yet again for her son Max’s third grade class, but as her husband buries himself in work, her older daughters navigate adulthood, and Jen’s own aging parents start to need some parenting themselves, Jen gets pulled in more directions than any one mom, or superhero, can handle. </p> <p>Refreshingly down-to-earth and brimming with warmth, Dixon’s next chapter will keep you wondering what’s really going on under the veneer of polite parent interactions and have you laughing along with her the whole way. </p>";
