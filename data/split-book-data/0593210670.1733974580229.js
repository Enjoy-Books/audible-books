window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>National Best Seller • </b><b><i>People</i></b><b> Pick •</b> <b>Optioned by Sister Pictures for Television •</b> <b>The discovery of a girl abandoned by the side of the road threatens to unearth the long-buried secrets of a Texas town’s legendary cold case in this superb, atmospheric novel from the internationally best-selling author of </b><b><i>Black-Eyed Susans</i></b></p> <p><b>“If you only read one thriller this year, let it be this one. Psychologically absorbing, original and atmospheric. I could not turn the pages fast enough.” (Elin Hilderbrand, number-one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>28 Summers</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>It’s been a decade since Trumanell Branson disappeared, leaving only a bloody handprint behind. Her pretty face still hangs like a watchful queen on the posters on the walls of the town’s Baptist church, the police station, and in the high school. They all promise the same thing: We will find you. Meanwhile, Tru's brother, Wyatt, lives as a pariah in the desolation of the old family house, cleared of wrongdoing by the police but tried and sentenced in the court of public opinion and in a new documentary about the crime.</p> <p>When Wyatt finds a lost girl dumped in a field of dandelions, making silent wishes, he believes she is a sign. The town’s youngest cop, Odette Tucker, believes she is a catalyst that will ignite a seething town still waiting for its own missing girl to come home. But Odette can’t look away. She shares a wound that won’t close with the mute, one-eyed mystery girl. And she is haunted by her own history with the missing Tru.</p> <p>Desperate to solve both cases, Odette fights to save the lost girl in the present and to dig up the shocking truth about a fateful night in the past—the night her friend disappeared, the night that inspired her to become a cop, the night that wrote them all a role in the town’s dark, violent mythology.</p> <p>In this twisty psychological thriller, Julia Heaberlin paints unforgettable portraits of a woman and a girl who redefine perceptions of physical beauty and strength.</p> <p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>We Are All the Same in the Dark</i></b></p> <p><b>“This chilling tale of buried sins is relentlessly unpredictable.” (</b><b><i>The Times</i></b><b>, South Africa)</b></p> <p><b>“[Julia] Heaberlin knows how to build to a truly shocking twist, how to break a reader’s heart and then begin mending it. ‘What’s coming is always unimaginable,’ Odette’s one-time therapist tells her, ‘and by that, I mean just that. It cannot be imagined. What’s coming never acts or behaves the way we think it will.’ That’s true for this novel, too.” (</b><b><i>The</i></b> <b><i>Dallas Morning News</i></b><b>)</b></p>";
