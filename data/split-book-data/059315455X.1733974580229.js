window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>Best Seller • </b></p> <p><b>One juror changed the verdict. What if she was wrong?</b> <b>From the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of </b><b><i>The Imitation Game</i></b><b> and best-selling author of </b><b><i>The Last Days of Night....</i></b></p> <p><b>An ID Book Club Selection • </b></p> <p><b>“Exhilarating...a fiendishly slippery game of cat-and-mouse suspense and a provocative, urgent inquiry into American justice (and injustice) in the 21st century.” (A. J. Finn, number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>The Woman in the Window</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>It’s the most sensational case of the decade. Fifteen-year-old Jessica Silver, heiress to a billion-dollar real estate fortune, vanishes on her way home from school, and her teacher, Bobby Nock, a 25-year-old African American man, is the prime suspect. The subsequent trial taps straight into America’s most pressing preoccupations: race, class, sex, law enforcement, and the lurid sins of the rich and famous. It’s an open-and-shut case for the prosecution, and a quick conviction seems all but guaranteed - until Maya Seale, a young woman on the jury, convinced of Nock’s innocence, persuades the rest of the jurors to return the verdict of not guilty, a controversial decision that will change all their lives forever.</p> <p>Flash forward ten years. A true-crime docuseries reassembles the jury, with particular focus on Maya, now a defense attorney herself. When one of the jurors is found dead in Maya’s hotel room, all evidence points to her as the killer. Now, she must prove her own innocence - by getting to the bottom of a case that is far from closed.</p> <p>As the present-day murder investigation entwines with the story of what really happened during their deliberation, told by each of the jurors in turn, the secrets they have all been keeping threaten to come out - with drastic consequences for all involved.</p>";
