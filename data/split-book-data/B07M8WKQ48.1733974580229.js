window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>What really happened the night Edie died? Years later, her best friend Lindsay will learn how unprepared she is for the truth in this “impressive debut” (</b><b><i>People</i></b><b>) from the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of the Reese’s Book Club pick </b><b><i>We Were Never Here</i></b><b>.<br> <br> NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY </b><b><i>BuzzFeed </i></b><b>• </b><b><i>Glamour </i></b><b>• </b><b><i>Real Simple </i></b><b>• </b><b><i>Marie Claire </i></b><b>• </b><b><i>Library Journal </i></b><b>• </b><b><i>Booklist </i></b><b>• </b><b><i>CrimeReads</i></b><br> <br> In 2009, Edie had New York’s social world in her thrall. Mercurial and beguiling, she was the shining star of a group of recent graduates living in a Brooklyn loft and treating New York like their playground. When Edie’s body was found near a suicide note at the end of a long, drunken night, no one could believe it. Grief, shock, and resentment scattered the group and brought the era to an abrupt end.<br> <br> A decade later, Lindsay has come a long way from the drug-addled world of Calhoun Lofts. She has devoted best friends, a cozy apartment, and a thriving career as a magazine’s head fact-checker. But when a chance reunion leads Lindsay to discover an unsettling video from that hazy night, she starts to wonder if Edie was actually murdered—and, worse, if she herself was involved. As she rifles through those months in 2009—combing through case files, old technology, and her fractured memories—Lindsay is forced to confront the demons of her own violent history to bring the truth to light.</p>";
