window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Readers will delight in this laugh-out-loud cozy mystery debut - and relish the country cooking recipes included. </p> <p>This debut mystery introduces Magdalena Yoder, prim, proper, and persnickety proprietor of the PennDutch Inn, where guests luxuriate in the true \"Amish experience,\" (read: doing Magdalena's chores and paying top dollar for the opportunity!). </p> <p>When one of her more reclusive guests takes a tumble down the PennDutch's picturesquely steep staircase and breaks his neck, the timing couldn't be worse. It's the start of hunting season - and her inn is packed to capacity! </p> <p>What at first seems to be a horrible accident (and insurance nightmare for Magdalena!) could turn out to be a much more sinister event; and when another mishap occurs, Magdalena is certain there is a killer in her group - and it's up to her to sniff out the culprit…before the world's most incompetent town sheriff throws her in jail!</p>";
