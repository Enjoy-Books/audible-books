window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Eight years ago, Poke Rafferty, an American travel writer, and his Thai wife, Rose, adopted a Bangkok street child named Miaow, forming an unconventional intercultural family. That family has weathered extreme challenges - each of its three members carried the scars of a painful and dangerous history - but has stuck together with tenacity and love (and a little help from some friends). </p> <p>Now that family is in jeopardy: the birth of Poke and Roseâ€™s newborn son has littered their small apartment with emotional land mines, forcing Poke to question his identity as a dad and Miaow to question her identity as a daughter. At the same time, the most cantankerous member of the small gang of Old Bangkok Hands who hang out at the Expat Bar suddenly goes missing under suspicious circumstances. Engaged in the search for the missing American, Poke is caught completely off-guard when someone he thought was gone forever resurfaces - and she has the power to tear the Raffertys apart.</p>";
