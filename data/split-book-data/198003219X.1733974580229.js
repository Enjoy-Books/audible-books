Four different women rush to offer confessions, each insisting that they committed the crime - alone. Ginger is holding her family together by a thread, and this wedding weekend is not the fabulous getaway she anticipated. </p> <p>Kate has enough money to buy her way out of anything. Well, almost anything. Emily can't shake her reputation or her memories, and she's planning to drown this whole vacation in a bottle. </p> <p>Lulu's got ex-husbands to spare, and another on the way - as soon as she figures out what the devil the current husband is up to behind her back. </p> <p>Why would they confess to the same murder? Only they know - and they're not telling. This pause-resisting novel explores the depths of friendship and the truths we love to ignore.</p>";
