And, as Michael leads his charges to safety, he begins to realize that the engine failure was not an isolated incident. <p>Juniper Mackenzie was singing and playing guitar in a pub when her small Oregon town was thrust into darkness. Cars refused to start. Phones were silent. And when an airliner crashed, no sirens sounded and no fire trucks arrived. Now, taking refuge in her family's cabin with her daughter and a growing circle of friends, Juniper is determined to create a farming community to benefit the survivors of this crisis.</p> <p>But even as people band together to help one another, others are building armies for conquest.</p>";
