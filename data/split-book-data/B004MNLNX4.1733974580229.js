window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Book one of the <i>New York Times </i>best-selling All Souls Series—\"a wonderfully imaginative grown-up fantasy with all the magic of <i>Harry Potter</i> and <i>Twilight</i>” (<i>People</i>).</p> <p>Now “[a] hot show that’s like <i>Twilight</i> meets <i>Outlander</i>” (<i>Thrillist</i>) airing on AMC and BBC America, as well as streaming on Sundance Now and Shudder.</p> <p>Deborah Harkness’s sparkling debut, A Discovery of Witches, has brought her into the spotlight and galvanized fans around the world. In this tale of passion and obsession, Diana Bishop, a young scholar and a descendant of witches, discovers a long-lost and enchanted alchemical manuscript, Ashmole 782, deep in Oxford's Bodleian Library. Its reappearance summons a fantastical underworld, which she navigates with her leading man, vampire geneticist Matthew Clairmont.</p> <p>Harkness has created a universe to rival those of Anne Rice, Diana Gabaldon, and Elizabeth Kostova, and she adds a scholar's depth to this riveting tale of magic and suspense. The story continues in book two, <i>Shadow of Night</i>, book three, <i>The Book of Life</i>, and the fourth in the series, <i>Time’s Convert</i>.</p>";
