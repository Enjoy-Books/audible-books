Now with a single faultless shot, Detective Harry Bosch thinks he has ended the city's nightmare.</p> <p>But the dead man's widow is suing Harry and the LAPD for killing the wrong man - an accusation that rings terrifyingly true when a new victim is discovered with the Dollmaker's macabre signature.</p> <p>So for the second time, Harry must hunt down a death-dealer who is very much alive, before he strikes again.
