window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>On December 29, 1890, American troops opened fire with howitzers on hundreds of unarmed Lakota Sioux men, women, and children near Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota, killing nearly 300 Sioux. As acclaimed historian Heather Cox Richardson shows in Wounded Knee, the massacre grew out of a set of political forces all too familiar to us today: fierce partisanship, heated political rhetoric, and an irresponsible, profit-driven media.</p> <p>Richardson tells a dramatically new story about the Wounded Knee massacre, revealing that its origins lay not in the West, but in the corridors of political power back East. Politicians in Washington, Democrat and Republican alike, sought to set the stage for mass murder by exploiting an age-old political tool—fear.</p> <p>Assiduously researched and beautifully written, <i>Wounded Knee</i> will be the definitive account of an epochal American tragedy.</p>";
