window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's the most dangerous case of Will Trent's career. He knows this from the moment he sets foot in the abandoned Atlanta warehouse where a body lies on the floor—the body of an ex-cop. Bloody footprints leading away from the scene reveal that another victim, evidently a woman, was carried away and has vanished into thin air. And, worst of all, the warehouse belongs to the city's biggest and most high-profile athlete—a local hero protected by the world's most expensive lawyers. A hero married to Will's ex-wife. A hero whom Will's superiors at the Georgia Bureau of Investigation have spent the last six months investigating for rape.</p> <p>But for Will—and also for Sara Linton, the GBI's newest medical examiner—the case is about to get even worse. Because an unexpected discovery at the scene reveals a personal link to Will's troubled past, and the consequences will wreak havoc on his life and the lives of those he loves, those he works with, and those he pursues.</p> <p>Relentlessly suspenseful and furiously paced, <i>The Kept Woman</i> marks Karin Slaughter's triumphant return to her most popular series.</p>";
