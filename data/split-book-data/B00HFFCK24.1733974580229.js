window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR: <i>Blood Money</i> is an extensive rewrite of a book I wrote a few years ago called \"Russo's Gold.\" While I was satisfied with most of \"Russo's Gold,\" there were parts of it that I wanted to improve. I also wanted to incorporate it into the Joe Dillard series, and that is what I've done. I hope you enjoy it.—Scott Pratt</p> <p>A secret buried deep in the past is on the verge of coming to light.</p> <p>Its discovery could trigger malevolent forces that have lain in wait for decades.</p> <p>In the sixth volume of the best-selling Joe Dillard series, Dillard does something he has never done before—he hires a young associate. Her name is Charleston Story, she is bright and beautiful, and in her very first case, she winds up inheriting an item so valuable that it threatens to destroy her and everything she cares about. As Dillard tries to help and advise his young protégé, he finds himself dragged into a web of danger and intrigue, a web so thick that he may never be able to extract himself.</p>";
