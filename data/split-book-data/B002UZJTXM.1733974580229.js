window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>NATIONAL BESTSELLER • The most famous true crime novel of all time \"chills the blood and exercises the intelligence\" (</b><b><i>The New York Review of Books</i></b><b>)—and haunted its author long after he finished writing it.<br> </b><br> On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. <br> <br> In one of the first non-fiction novels ever written, Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, generating both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. <i>In Cold Blood</i> is a work that transcends its moment, yielding poignant insights into the nature of American violence.</p>";
