To find out why, Brienne must leave the safety of her home to hunt a familiar stranger.</p> <p>What she discovers is more disturbing than she could have ever imagined. With her fragile mind close to shattering, Brienne is prepared to do anything to reclaim her life. If it’s even hers to reclaim.</p>";
