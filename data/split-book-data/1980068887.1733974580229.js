window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Artificial intelligence is our last hope of saving the war-ravaged Earth in this near-future science-fiction thriller from the apocalyptic mind of </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Nicholas Sansbury Smith (Hell Divers, The Extinction Cycle, Orbs). </b></p> <p>The most advanced soldiers in human history are about to become obsolete.</p> <p>Engines. Genetically modified warriors that keep the great Nova Alliance war machine churning against the enemy Coalition. Most days, Engines are all that stand between salvation and chaos. Led by legendary Engine Captain Akira Hayashi, Shadow Squad has fought on the frontlines for a decade. They are on the brink of victory when the Coalition launches a series of desperate and devastating attacks that cripple the Nova Alliance restoration sites vital to save the dying planet.</p> <p>As the sites burn and Earth’s hope of salvation fades, Shadow Squad is equipped with neural implants to connect them to Apeiron, the first hybrid human-AI entity. She is coded for what Captain Hayashi believes is an impossible task - peace. But war isn’t the only threat to the Earth. Apeiron has uncovered a deadly secret with implications that could end all life. This rapidly approaching threat can be stopped only if humanity bands together on what will become known as E-Day, a pivotal moment that will determine the evolution - or the extinction - of the entire human race.</p>";
