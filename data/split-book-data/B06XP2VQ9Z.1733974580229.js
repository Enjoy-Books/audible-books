window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The final installment in Sue Grafton's Alphabet Series - Winner of the Anthony/Bill Crider Award for Best Novel in a Series </p> <p>Private investigator Kinsey Millhone confronts her darkest and most disturbing case in this number-one <i>New York Times </i>best seller from Sue Grafton.</p> <p>In 1979, four teenage boys from an elite private school sexually assault a 14-year-old classmate - and film the attack. Not long after, the tape goes missing and the suspected thief, a fellow classmate, is murdered. In the investigation that follows, one boy turns state’s evidence and two of his peers are convicted. But the ringleader escapes without a trace. </p> <p>Now, it’s 1989 and one of the perpetrators, Fritz McCabe, has been released from prison. Moody, unrepentant, and angry, he is a virtual prisoner of his ever-watchful parents - until a copy of the missing tape arrives with a ransom demand. That’s when the McCabes call Kinsey Millhone for help. As she is drawn into their family drama, she keeps a watchful eye on Fritz. But he’s not the only one being haunted by the past. A vicious sociopath with a grudge against Millhone may be leaving traces of himself for her to find....</p>";
