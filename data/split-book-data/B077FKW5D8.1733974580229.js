window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The astonishing novel from the number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Jodi Picoult about a young boy with autism falsely accused of murder. </p> <p>When your son can't look you in the eye...does that mean he's guilty? </p> <p>Jacob Hunt is a teen with Asperger's syndrome. He's hopeless at reading social cues or expressing himself well to others, though he is brilliant in many ways. But he has a special focus on one subject - forensic analysis. A police scanner in his room clues him in to crime scenes, and he's always showing up and telling the cops what to do. And he's usually right. </p> <p>But when Jacob's small hometown is rocked by a terrible murder, law enforcement comes to him. Jacob's behaviors are hallmark Asperger's, but they look a lot like guilt to the local police. Suddenly the Hunt family, who only want to fit in, are directly in the spotlight. For Jacob's mother, Emma, it's a brutal reminder of the intolerance and misunderstanding that always threaten her family. For his brother, Theo, it's another indication why nothing is normal because of Jacob. </p> <p>And over this small family, the soul-searing question looms: Did Jacob commit murder? </p>";
