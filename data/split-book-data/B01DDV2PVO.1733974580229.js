Joe O'Loughlin is drawn into the investigation when a former student, trading on Joe's reputation by calling himself \"the Mindhunter\", jeopardizes the police inquiry by leaking details to the media and stirring up public anger. </p> <p>Joe discovers a link between the farmhouse murders and a series of vicious attacks in which the victims are choked unconscious and brutally scarred. Now Joe must stop a ruthless and brash criminal who has apparently graduated to murder. </p> <p>Much to his surprise, he is ably assisted by his eldest daughter, now a keen and courageous observer in her own right.
