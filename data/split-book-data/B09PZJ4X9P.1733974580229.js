window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Pandemic lockdowns have Ruth Galloway feeling isolated from everyone but a new neighbor—until Nelson comes calling, investigating a decades-long string of murder-suicides that’s looming ever closer, in </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> Elly Griffiths’ penultimate novel in the beloved series.</b></p> <p>Three years after her mother’s death, Ruth is finally sorting through her things when she finds a curious relic: a decades-old photograph of her own Norfolk cottage—<i>before </i>she lived there—with a peculiar inscription on the back. Ruth returns to the cot­tage to uncover its meaning as Norfolk’s first cases of Covid-19 make headlines, leaving her and Kate to shelter in place there. They struggle to stave off isolation by clapping for frontline workers each evening and befriending a kind neighbor, Zoe, from a distance.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Nelson is investigating a series of deaths of women that may or may not be suicide. When he links a case to an archaeological dis­covery, he breaks curfew to visit Ruth and enlist her help. But the further Nelson investigates the deaths, the closer he gets to Ruth’s isolated cot­tage—until Ruth, Zoe, and Kate all go missing, and Nelson is left scrambling to find them before it’s too late.</p> <p><b>PRAISE FOR ELLY GRIFFITHS AND THE RUTH GALLOWAY SERIES</b></p> <p>Winner of the Edgar Award for Best Novel</p> <p>Winner of the Mary Higgins Clark Award</p> <p>Winner of the CWA Dagger in the Library Award</p> <p>“Galloway is an everywoman, smart, successful and a little bit unsure of herself.
