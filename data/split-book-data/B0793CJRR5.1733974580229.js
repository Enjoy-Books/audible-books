window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From Jessica Knoll - author of <i>Luckiest Girl Alive</i>, the instant <i>New York Times</i> best seller and the best-selling debut novel of 2015 - comes a blisteringly paced thriller starring competitive sisters whose dark secrets and lies result in murder when they sign on to a reality TV show. </p> <p>When five hypersuccessful women agree to appear on a reality series set in New York City called <i>Goal Diggers</i>, the producers never expect the season will end in murder.... </p> <p>Brett's the fan favorite. Tattooed and only 27, the meteoric success of her spin studio - and her recent engagement to her girlfriend - has made her the object of jealousy and vitriol from her castmates. </p> <p>Kelly, Brett's older sister and business partner, is the most recent recruit, dismissed as a hanger-on by veteran cast. The golden child growing up, she defers to Brett now - a role that requires her to protect their shocking secret. </p> <p>Stephanie, the first black cast member and the oldest, is a successful best-selling author of erotic novels. There have long been whispers about her hot, nonworking actor-husband and his wandering eye, but this season the focus is on the rift that has opened between her and Brett, former best friends - and resentment soon breeds contempt. </p> <p>Lauren, the start-up world's darling whose drinking has gotten out of control, is <i>Goal Diggers</i>' recovery narrative - everyone loves a comeback story. </p> <p>And Jen, made rich and famous through her cultishly popular vegan food line plays a holistic hippie for the cameras but is perhaps the most ruthless of them all when the cameras are off. </p> <p><i>The Favorite Sister</i> explores the invisible barriers that prevent women from rising up the ranks in today's America - and offers a scathing take on the oft-lionized bonds of sisterhood and the relentless pressure to stay young, relevant, and salable. </p>";
