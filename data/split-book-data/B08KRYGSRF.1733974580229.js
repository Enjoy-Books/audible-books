window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Madison walked through the fallen snow, looking left and right. It had been Kaylee’s idea to use the trail through the forest; she said no one would follow them. But Madison lost sight of Kaylee for a moment and when she found her again she wasn’t alone....</b></p> <p>In the remote forests of Stillwater, Minnesota, you can scream for days and no one will hear you. So when the bodies of two 15-year-old girls are discovered frozen in the snow, Special Agent Nikki Hunt is sure the killer is local: Someone knew where to hide the girls and thought they would never be found. </p> <p>Though Nikki hasn’t been home in 20 years, she knows she must take over the case. The Sheriff’s department in Stillwater has already made a mistake by connecting the girls’ murders to those of a famous serial killer, refusing to consider the idea that the killer could be someone from town. </p> <p>Then another girl’s body is found, a red silk ribbon tied in her hair, and Nikki realizes that the killer has a connection to her own dark past, and the reason she left Stillwater. </p> <p><b>Nikki is not the only person in town who wants those secrets to stay hidden. Will she be able to face her demons before another child is taken?</b> </p> <p><b>Gripping and spine-chilling, </b><b><i>The Girls in the Snow</i></b> <b>will make you gasp until the final heart-pounding twist.
