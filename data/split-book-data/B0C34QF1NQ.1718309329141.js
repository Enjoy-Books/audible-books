Is Anna O a sleeping beauty or a sleeping killer? Matthew Blake's tension-filled thriller is&nbsp;as elusive and mysterious as sleep itself.”</strong>—<strong>Nita Prose, #1&nbsp;<em>New York Times&nbsp;</em>author of&nbsp;<em>The Maid</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Mystery Guest</em></strong></p><p><strong>Joining the ranks of Gillian Flynn, A. J. Finn, and Alex Michaelides, Matthew Blake delivers the thriller of the year: a dark, twisty, and shocking mystery about a young woman who commits a double murder while sleepwalking, and then never opens her eyes again.</strong></p><p><strong>ANNA O WILL WAKE UP THE WORLD</strong></p><p><em>What if your nightmares weren’t really nightmares at all?</em></p><p>We spend an average of 33 years of our lives asleep. But what really happens, and what are we capable of, when we sleep?</p><p>Anna Ogilvy was a budding twenty-five-year-old writer with a bright future. Then, one night, she stabbed two people to death with no apparent motive—and hasn’t woken up since. Dubbed “Sleeping Beauty” by the tabloids, Anna’s condition is a rare psychosomatic disorder known to neurologists as “resignation syndrome.”</p><p>Dr. Benedict Prince is a forensic psychologist and an expert in the field of sleep-related homicides. His methods are the last hope of solving the infamous “Anna O’”case and waking Anna up so she can stand trial. But he must be careful treating such a high-profile suspect—he’s got career secrets and a complicated personal life of his own.</p><p>As Anna shows the first signs of stirring, Benedict must determine what really happened and whether Anna should be held responsible for her crimes.</p><p>Only Anna knows the truth about that night, but only Benedict knows how to discover it. And they’re both in danger from what they find out.</p>";
