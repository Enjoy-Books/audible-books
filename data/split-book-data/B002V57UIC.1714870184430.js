The trial was harrowing enough, but now it's triggered a recurring and haunting dream in which Lucy, as a little girl, watches a gang of men bury a young woman's body in the woods.<p>Dr. Delaware hopes to find the creepy dream's origin through hypnosis and to bring to the surface what seems to be Lucy's buried childhood memory. When she becomes adamant that her life is in grave danger, it's up to Dr. Delaware to find out if her fears are imagined or if a desperate killer wants to eliminate a witness to a 20-year-old murder.</p>";
