window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the author of the Reese Witherspoon Book Club Pick</b><b><i> Wrong Place, Wrong Time</i></b><b>, comes a captivating, ingenious novel about a woman who must make an impossible decision....</b></p> <p><b>“A </b><b><i>Sliding Doors</i></b><b> thriller with a moral dilemma at its heart. Brilliant.”—Claire Douglas, author of </b><b><i>Last Seen Alive</i></b></p> <p>It's the end of a night out and Joanna is walking home alone. Then she hears the sound every woman dreads: footsteps behind her, getting faster. She's sure it's him—the man from the bar who wouldn't leave her alone. So Joanna makes a snap decision. She turns, she pushes. Her pursuer tumbles down the steps and lies motionless, facedown on the ground. Now what? </p> <p>Addictive and compelling,<i> The Choice </i>follows the two paths Joanna's future might take, depending on the choice she makes. If she calls the police right away, she can save the man's life. Yet doing so puts her own innocence at risk, as she waits for judgment on a charge of assault and the hope that her husband and everyone she loves will stand by her. But if she runs and goes home as if nothing has happened, no one will ever know. No one saw her do it, and it's only up to Joanna to keep quiet...forever.</p> <p><b>“Almost unbearably tense.”—</b><b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></p>";
