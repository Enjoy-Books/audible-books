window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“My dream novel. I devoured this in three days. The sharpest, clearest-eyed take on our #MeToo reckoning yet. Plus: enthralling.\" (Megan Abbott, Edgar Award-winning author of </b><b><i>Dare Me</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Fever</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>Following up on her acclaimed and wildly successful </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best seller </b><b><i>Lady in the Lake</i></b><b>, Laura Lippman returns with a dark, complex tale of psychological suspense with echoes of </b><b><i>Misery</i></b><b> involving a novelist, incapacitated by injury, who is plagued by mysterious phone calls.</b></p> <p><i>In the end, has anyone really led a blameless life?</i></p> <p>Injured in a freak fall, novelist Gerry Andersen is confined to a hospital bed in his glamorous high-rise apartment, dependent on two women he barely knows: his incurious young assistant, and a dull, slow-witted night nurse.</p> <p>Then late one night, the phone rings. The caller claims to be the “real” Aubrey, the alluring title character from his most successful novel, <i>Dream Girl</i>. But there is no real Aubrey. She’s a figment born of a writer’s imagination, despite what many believe or claim to know. Could the cryptic caller be one of his three ex-wives playing a vindictive trick after all these years? Or is she Margot, an ex-girlfriend who keeps trying to insinuate her way back into Gerry’s life?</p> <p>And why does no one believe that the call even happened?</p> <p>Isolated from the world, drowsy from medication, Gerry slips between reality and a dreamlike state in which he is haunted by his own past: his faithless father, his devoted mother; the women who loved him, the women he loved.</p> <p>And now here is Aubrey, threatening to visit him, suggesting that she is owed something. Is the threat real or is it a sign of dementia? Which scenario would he prefer? Gerry has never been so alone, so confused - and so terrified.</p> <p>Chilling and thoroughly enjoyable, touching on timely issues that include power, agency, appropriation, and creation, <i>Dream Girl</i> is a superb blend of psychological suspense and horror that reveals the mind and soul of a writer.</p>";
