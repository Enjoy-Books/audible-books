window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Cassia Vici is on a one-way trip to Saturn - to help humanity reach the stars.</b></p> <p>A towering genius who'd already solved the problem of death by making memory recording possible, Cassia leads a team of scientists and problem solvers to a station floating in the harsh winds of Saturn. Their mission: to grow interstellar ships using nanobots in the planet's material-rich environment. She called them \"monsters\" to help sell the project to a skeptical public.</p> <p>Little did she know how prophetic that name would become.</p> <p>But an unexpected death seeds doubt among the team, putting the mission in jeopardy. As her team struggles to save the future, Cassia is haunted by her past - a wife and daughter who died in the very technology that made mind recording possible.</p> <p>With time running out, Cassia and her crew will need one final miracle to build the monsters that could become both their savior - and their doom.</p>";
