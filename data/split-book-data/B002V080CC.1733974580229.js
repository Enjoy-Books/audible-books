window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Edgar Award-winner Harlan Coben is at his electrifying best in his latest novel - a dazzling tale of seething mystery and dark family secrets. </p> <p>In<i> Darkest Fear</i>, Myron Bolitar faces the most emotionally shattering case of his career. And it all begins when Myron's ex-girlfriend tells him he is a father - of a dying 13-year-old boy....</p> <p>Myron's sports agency is struggling. Now more than ever, Myron needs to keep his eye on the ball, sign up some big-name clients, and turn away from the amateur detective work that is taking precious time away from the agency. </p> <p>But life is not going according to plan. Myron's father, recently recovered from a heart attack, is facing his own mortality - and forcing Myron to face it, too. Then comes another surprise. Emily Downing, Myron's college sweetheart, reappears in his life with devastating news: Her 13-year-old son, Jeremy, is gravely ill and can be saved only by a bone-marrow transplant - from a donor who has vanished without a trace. And before Myron can absorb this revelation, Emily hits him with an even bigger shocker: Jeremy is Myron's son, conceived the night before Emily's wedding to another man.</p> <p>Staggered by the news, Myron plunges into a search for the missing donor. But for Myron, finding the only person in the world who can save a boy's life means cracking open a mystery as dark as it is heartbreaking - a mystery that involves a broken family, a brutal kidnapping spree, and a cat-and-mouse game between an ambitious reporter and the FBI. </p> <p>Somewhere in the sordid mess is the man who once signed his name to a bone-marrow donor's registry, then disappeared. And as doubts emerge about Jeremy's true paternity, a child vanishes, igniting a chain reaction of truth and revelation that will change everyone's life forever.</p> <p>At once a riveting mystery and a spellbinding journey into the secrets that haunt families, lovers, and friends, <i>Darkest Fear</i> proves once again that Harlan Coben is a master storyteller like no other - and one of the most original talents in suspense fiction today. </p>";
