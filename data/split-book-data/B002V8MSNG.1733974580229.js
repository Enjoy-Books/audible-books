window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i> is the book that Sigmund Freud considered his most important and that forever changed the way we think about our dreams. Here, Freud explained his discoveries about why we dream, what we dream, and what our dreams mean. </p> <p>In this groundbreaking work, Freud further demonstrated that it is in the treatment of abnormal mental states that dream analysis is the most valuable. He claimed that dreams not only reveal to us the cryptic mechanisms of phobias, obsessions, and delusions but also are the most potent weapon in the healing of them. </p> <p>This book is indispensable to anyone interested in dreams and dream analysis.</p>";
