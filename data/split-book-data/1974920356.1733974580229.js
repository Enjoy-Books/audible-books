window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After much tragedy and violence, Jack Taylor has at long last landed at contentment. Of course, he still knocks back too much Jameson and dabbles in uppers, but he has a new woman in his life, a freshly bought apartment, and little sign of trouble on the horizon. Once again, trouble comes to him - this time in the form of a wealthy Frenchman who wants Jack to investigate the double-murder of his twin sons. Jack is meanwhile roped into looking after his girlfriend's nine-year-old son and is in for a shock with the appearance of a character out of his past. The plot is one big chess game, and all of the pieces seem to be moving at the behest of one dangerously mysterious player, a vigilante called \"Silence\"...because he's the last thing his victims will ever hear. </p> <p>This is Ken Bruen at his most darkly humorous and most lovably bleak as he shows us the meaning behind a proverb of his own design - <i>the Irish can abide almost anything save silence.</i></p>";
