window.bookSummaryJSON = "Michael Robotham's <i>Suspect</i>, hailed as \"a lightning-paced debut\" by <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, was an international best seller that raised the bar for thrillers. Now two characters from that acclaimed novel, Detective Vincent Ruiz and psychologist Joe O'Loughlin, return for the electrifying <i>Lost</i>. When Detective Ruiz is pulled from the Thames, he has a bullet in his leg, a photograph of a missing (and presumed dead) girl in his pocket, and absolutely no memory of what happened.";
