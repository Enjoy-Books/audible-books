window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>2022 </b><b><i>NPR </i></b><b>Best Book of the Year, Long-listed</b></p> <p>“Once I began listening to Jesse Vilinksy's excellent narration I was immediately swept up in the story.” – Anne Bogel, <b>Modern Ms. Darcy</b></p> <p><b>From Alison Espach, author of the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> Editor’s Choice novel </b><b><i>The Adults</i></b><b>, comes a dazzlingly unconventional love story for listeners of </b><b><i>Ask Again, Yes</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Tell the Wolves I’m Home</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>For much of her life, Sally Holt has been mystified by the things her older sister, Kathy, seems to have been born knowing. Kathy has answers for all of Sally’s questions about life, about love, and about Billy Barnes, a rising senior and local basketball star who mans the concession stand at the town pool. The girls have been fascinated by Billy ever since he jumped off the roof in elementary school, but Billy has never shown much interest in them until the summer before Sally begins eighth grade. By then, their mutual infatuation with Billy is one of the few things the increasingly different sisters have in common. Sally spends much of that summer at the pool, watching in confusion and excitement as her sister falls deeper in love with Billy—until a tragedy leaves Sally’s life forever intertwined with his.</p> <p>Opening in the early nineties and charting almost two decades of shared history and missed connections, <i>Notes on Your Sudden Disappearance</i> is both a breathtaking love story about two broken people who are unexplainably, inconveniently drawn to each other and a wryly astute coming-of-age tale brimming with unexpected moments of joy.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Henry Holt &amp; Company.</b></p>";
