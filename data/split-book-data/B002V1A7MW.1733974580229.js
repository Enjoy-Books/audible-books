The girl's father denies the possibility of a political motive, leaving LAPD detective Milo Sturgis and his longtime friend, Alex Delaware, stymied. When another killing occurs, Alex finds himself ensnared in one of the most menacing cases of his career. The psychologist ultimately goes undercover to expose the smug brutality of a deadly conspiracy in Jonathan Kellerman's chilling portrait of evil.</p>";
