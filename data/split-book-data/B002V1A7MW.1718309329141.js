window.bookSummaryJSON = "Psychologist Dr. Alex Delaware confronts a killer who takes as much pleasure in matching wits with the police as in taking lives. <p> A diplomat's retarded daughter is murdered on a school field trip. The girl's father denies the possibility of a political motive, leaving LAPD detective Milo Sturgis and his longtime friend, Alex Delaware, stymied. When another killing occurs, Alex finds himself ensnared in one of the most menacing cases of his career. The psychologist ultimately goes undercover to expose the smug brutality of a deadly conspiracy in Jonathan Kellerman's chilling portrait of evil.</p>";
