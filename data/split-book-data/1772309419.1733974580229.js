window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Rescuers. Avengers. Thieves. Spies. </p> <p>The life of a knight mage is never easy, but sometimes the gods smile on you and grant you an errand of incredible complexity...without regards to casualties. </p> <p>When Tyndal and Rondal, journeymen wizards and knights errant, travel to southern Alshar to rescue a helpless boy and his mother, it sets in motion a series of events that will shake the foundations of the Five Duchies! While they are beginning their quest against the vast criminal gang known as the Brotherhood of the Rat, the two knights encounter the Cats of Enultramar, a family of shadowmagi (masters of shadow, illusion, and obfuscation) and high-class thieves who help them discover a plot to attack the rich lands and prosperous people of Alshar, from the Wilderlands to the Great Bay...and only Rondal and Tyndal can stop them.</p> <p>From thugs and thieves to irate Censors of Magic to dragons and undead, the intrepid pair face the challenges of a new land and an old enemy. For when a new, powerful threat in the form of the Necromancer of Olum Seheri looms against them, the brave young knights magi can only hope to defeat it with the help of a...shadowmage! </p> <p>Includes special bonus story \"The Spellmonger's Yule\"!</p>";
