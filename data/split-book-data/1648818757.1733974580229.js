window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"My name is Larkspur, and I am an Elemental.” </p> <p>My people use the power of the earth to sustain life and defy our enemies. I should be at my father's side as a royal princess. But as a half-breed, bastard child, that isn't going to happen. </p> <p>In a world of lava and fire, I am about to face my hardest trial yet. Not one of strength, or power, but intrigue and manipulation. However, my tolerance level for anyone outside of my family is at an all-time low, and the queen who rules the Pit expects complete obedience. </p> <p>As Ash’s life is held in the balance, I have just three days to prove his innocence and mine. This place holds more than a scorching heat; new foes, traitors, and creatures from the depths of the lava are all trying to keep us from surviving. </p> <p>The only question left: Can I get us all out without being burned alive? </p> <p>Welcome to the Pit. </p> <p>Performed by Yasmin Tuazon, Eric Messner, Holly Adams, Julie-Ann Elliott, Anthony Palmini, Rob McFadyen, Rayner Gabriel, Debi Tinsley, Yasmin Tuazon, Alejandro Ruiz, Bradley Smith, Carolyn Kashner, Chris Davenport, Christopher Williams, Colleen Delany, Danny Gavigan, Gabriel Michael, Karen Novack, Ken Jackson, Laura C.
