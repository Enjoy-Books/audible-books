She doesn’t want to leave her daughter with her ex and fly to Charleston. She doesn’t want to deal with her family home, stuffed to the rafters with the remnants of her father’s academic career and her mother’s lifelong obsession with puppets and dolls. She doesn’t want to learn how to live without the two people who knew and loved her best in the world.</p> <p>Most of all, she doesn’t want to deal with her brother, Mark, who never left their hometown, gets fired from one job after another, and resents her success. Unfortunately, she’ll need his help to get the house ready for sale because it’ll take more than some new paint on the walls and clearing out a lifetime of memories to get this place on the market. <br> <br> But some houses don’t want to be sold, and their home has other plans for both of them…</p> <p>Like his novels <i>The Southern Book Club’s Guide to Slaying Vampires</i> and <i>The Final Girl Support Group</i>, <i>How to Sell a Haunted House</i> is classic Hendrix: equal parts heartfelt and terrifying—a gripping new read from “the horror master” (<i>USA Today</i>).</p>";
